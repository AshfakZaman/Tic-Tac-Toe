Here I've coded this Tic-Tac-Toe game assuming two players will be playing it. At first Player 1 needs to choose his/her mark (either 'X' or 'O'). then, Player 1 needs to choose his/her place (out of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9... these 9 places will be showing in a 3 row x 3 column board), to put his/her chosen mark. And, then turn for player 2 comes. this way the game keeps on going.

All required functions are in module named “Tic_Tac_Toe_All_Functions.py” … and .. to play the game, one needs to run script named “Tic_Tac_Toe game loop.py”
